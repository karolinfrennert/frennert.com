        <h2>About me</h2>
      </a>
      <div class="about-text">
        <p>Growing up I always had different interest, trying to find something that really <i>really</i> makes me
          interested. When I was introduced to coding, something I've always been curious about but never dared to try,
          I was hooked. The constant rollercoaster of sucess and failure, feeling like you know everything in
          one moment and then feeling completely helpless in the next really interested me. The ability to
          create and visualise your ideas and making them into real projects, as well as the fact that there is always
          something more to learn, makes me strive to become better, every day. </p>

        <p>Apart from coding I love cats, some may call me a crazy cat lady. I also love to travel, as it brings the
          world closer to you and opens up your ability to understand others and see things from different perspectives.
          However, most of the time I am stuck infront of my computer trying to learn new concepts, and better
          udnerstand code, design and everything that comes with the interactions of the web.
